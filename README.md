Magnum is 3D graphics engine written in C++11 and OpenGL 3 Core Profile.
Features:

 * Easy-to-use templated mathematical library for matrix/vector calculations.
 * Comprehensive use of C++11 features for safety, performance and ease of
   development.
 * Hierarchical scene graph which supports transformation caching for better
   performance, classes for convenient usage of shaders, buffers and textures.
 * Mesh tools for cleaning, optimizing and generating meshes. Collection of
   pre-made graphic primitives and shaders for testing purposes.

INSTALLATION
============

You can either use packaging scripts, which are stored in package/
subdirectory, or compile and install everything manually. Note that Doxygen
documentation contains more comprehensive guide for building, packaging and
crosscompiling.

Minimal dependencies
--------------------

 * C++ compiler with good C++11 support. Currently the only compiler which
   supports everything needed is **GCC** >= 4.6. **Clang** >= 3.1 (from SVN)
   will probably work too.
 * **CMake** >= 2.6
 * **OpenGL headers**, on Linux most probably shipped with Mesa
 * **GLEW** - OpenGL extension wrangler
 * **Corrade** - Plugin management and utility library. You can get it at
   http://mosra.cz/blog/corrade.php

Compilation, installation
-------------------------

The library can be built and installed using these four commands:

    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .. && make
    make install

Building and running unit tests
-------------------------------

If you want to build also unit tests (which are not built by default), pass
`-DBUILD_TESTS=True` to CMake. Unit tests use QtTest framework (you need at
least **Qt 4.6**) and can be run using

    ctest -V

in build directory. Everything should pass ;-)

Building documentation
----------------------

The documentation (which you are currently reading) is written in **Doxygen**
(preferrably 1.8 with Markdown support, but older versions should do good job
too) and additionally uses **Graphviz** for class diagrams. The documentation
can be build by running

    doxygen

in root directory (i.e. where `Doxyfile` is). Resulting HTML documentation
will be in `build/doc/` directory.

PLUGINS AND EXAMPLES
====================

Various importer plugins for image and 3D model formats are maintained in
separate repository, which can be found at
http://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins .

There are also examples of engine usage, varying from simple *Hello
World*-like example to more advanced applications, such as viewer for complex
3D models. Example repository is at http://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples .
